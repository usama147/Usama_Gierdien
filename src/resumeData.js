      <>
        <p>
          I'm a highly motivated and creative individual with a strong passion
          for technology and web development. My journey in the field of web
          development began during my time as a web development intern at LC
          Studios, where I got my first hands-on experience in creating and
          maintaining websites. This invaluable opportunity served as the
          foundation of my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subsequently, I had the privilege of working at ShiftOne Digital, a
          renowned company known for its expertise in building dynamic WordPress
          websites for clients. During my tenure at ShiftOne Digital, I further
          honed my skills by utilizing various popular page builders such as
          Elementor, Beaver Builder, Visual Composer, and WP Bakery.
        </p>
        <p>
          My responsibilities extended beyond website creation; I also focused on
          ensuring the functionality, performance, and user-friendliness of the
          sites. Maintenance was a crucial aspect of my role, and I took pride in
          keeping our clients' websites up-to-date, secure, and optimized for the
          best user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always been a naturally curious individual with a relentless
          desire to understand how things work. This curiosity and determination
          have been with me since childhood when I found myself captivated by
          video games and always eager to explore the inner workings behind the
          screens. This innate curiosity and problem-solving drive led me to
          explore the world of coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I had the opportunity to study coding, I seized it with enthusiasm
          and knew precisely what I wanted to pursue after high school. In the
          dynamic world of technology, where innovation and change are constant,
          I am committed to being a part of this ever-evolving landscape. I strive
          to bring creativity and innovation to my work, and I am not afraid to
          persevere in the face of challenges. I believe that my background and
          experiences have equipped me with the skills and mindset to thrive in
          the exciting and everchanging realm of technology.
